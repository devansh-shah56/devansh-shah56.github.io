      <h2> My Story Until Now </h2>
      <p>
        Hi world, I'm Devansh and I'm passionate about life! 
        This website will serve as my collection of experiences as I travel around the world, read books, cook new dishes and make mistakes. 
        I am excited to see how this website progresses ahead in the future and I look forward to it growing!

        So a brief introduction about me, I'm a BTech in Bioengineering graduate from the <a href="https://iitj.ac.in/"target="_blank" style="color: teal;">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Jodhpur</a> where I ranked 1st in my department. 
        My passion lies at the intersection of biology and technology, where I've developed innovative solutions like  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2025.04.027"target="_blank" style="color: teal;">MitoEdit</a>  for targeted mitochondrial base editing and a RT-PCR diagnostic kit for Glioblastoma classification.
        I was selected as a <a href="https://iusstf.org/khorana-program-for-scholars"target="_blank" style="color: teal;">Khorana Scholar</a> during the summer of 2024, through which I visited <a href="https://www.stjude.org/"target="_blank" style="color: teal;">St. Jude Children's Research Hospital</a> in Memphis, TN, contributing to research on mitochondrial base editing. 
        Further, I was able to extend my stay in Memphis for an entire semester by pursuing a specialization in Engineering Innovation, making me one of the first students from IITJ to pursue this opportunity.
        Beyond academics, I've embraced various leadership roles, from directing the Rotaract Club of IITJ to serving as a Student Guide in the Student Wellbeing Committee. 
        When not in the lab, you'll find me exploring underwater worlds as a PADI certified diver, capturing wildlife through my camera lens, or competing in sports especially football. 
        With proficiency in multiple programming languages and laboratory techniques, I'm equipped to tackle complex challenges at the frontier of bioengineering and I look forward to take on those challenges.
