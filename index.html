      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi world, I'm Devansh! I'm passionate about life ig. This website will serve as my collection of experiences as I travel around the world, read books and make mistakes. I am excited to see how this website progresses ahead in the future and I look forward to it growing!

I'm a Bioengineering graduate from IIT Jodhpur where I ranked 1st in my department with a 9.11/10 CGPA. My passion lies at the intersection of biology and technology, where I've developed innovative solutions like MitoEdit for targeted mitochondrial base editing and a RT-PCR diagnostic kit for Glioblastoma classification. As a Khorana Scholar, I conducted research at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, contributing to published work in the Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal. Beyond academics, I've embraced leadership roles across campus organizations, from directing the Rotaract Club to serving as Secretary of Shutterbugs Photography Society. My commitment to community service extends through my work with Arham Yuva Seva Group, providing meals to 1,500+ individuals across Mumbai. When not in the lab, you'll find me exploring underwater worlds as a PADI certified diver, capturing wildlife through my camera lens, or competing in sportsâ€”having placed first in Inter-College Football at Varchas Sports Fest. With proficiency in multiple programming languages and laboratory techniques, I'm equipped to tackle complex challenges at the frontier of bioengineering and computational biology.
