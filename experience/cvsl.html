        Before joining The Cathedral Vidya School Lonavala (CVSL), a residential school in Lonavala, I was in the Gopi Birla Memorial School (GBMS).
        My decision to switch school and move to a boarding school was a result of my sister leaving home and beginning her medical college life.
        Seeing her enjoying hostel life made me curious so I pushed my parents to put me in a boarding school (might be the first time in history someone must have done lol!)
        Initially, I was under the impression that boarding school was for students who were very mischievous or naughty and there is a lot of bullying/ragging incidents in such schools, and this really scared me before joining school.
        Nevertheless, I definitely had one of the best times in CVSL because that's the place where I truly grew and became mature.
        I got into all kinds of sports from water polo to squash to football. I made some great friends and even had a few flings which I remember to-date.
        All-in-all it was a good decision and I am happy that my parents took this bold decision of sending me away from home at such an early age!
